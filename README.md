## Usage

### Installation

You can install this script, as is, to use it as a CLI:
```bash
$ go install github.com/dreamdata-io/sftp-upload@latest
```

or you can clone the repository and run the script directly:
```bash
$ git clone github.com/dreamdata-io/sftp-upload
$ cd sftp-upload
```

### Running
To upload files to the sftp server, you can run the following command:
- with CLI:
```bash
$ sftp-upload -username <username> path/to/file_1.csv path/to/dir
```
- with Go script:
```bash
$ go run main.go -username <username> path/to/file_1.csv path/to/dir
```
- with Python script:
```bash
$ python main.py -username <username> path/to/file_1.csv path/to/dir
```
You can specify multiple files and directories to upload.

You will be prompted for the sftp login password, that is the same one you can get on the Dreamdata(c) platform.
```
> Enter your password for <username>:
```

If any directories are specified, the script will attempt to upload all files in the directory.
You will be prompted to confirm the upload for each directory.
```
> You will upload all files in path/to/dir. Continue? (y/[n])
```

You must type `y` to confirm the upload. If you type anything else, the upload will skip the directory.

You can skip all directory prompts by specifying the `--no-prompt` flag.
```bash
$ sftp-upload -username <username> --no-prompt path/to/file_1.csv path/to/dir
```

The command will upload all supported files specified in paths to the sftp server.
